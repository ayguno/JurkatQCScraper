# JurkatQCScraper

## JurkatQCscraper is a comprehensive online analytics tool to monitor Mass Spectrometer Performance. It is build by using Rshiny package.

- Mass Spectrometry users inject 1 ug tryptic Jurkat cell peptide mixture to instruments and run a 110 min gradient with a standardized LC-MS/MS run method. 
- This provides an objective quality control that helps to monitor instrument performance by using powerful Quality Metrics provided by Spectrum Mill. 
- JurkatQC Scraper actively monitors servers to detect new Jurkat Quality Metrics, provided that the raw files were searched in Spectrum Mill. 
- JurkatQC Scraper archives Quality Metrics data, extracts useful LC_labels, time and user attributes, and present helpful data analytics. 
- JurkatQC Scraper also provides a user interface to obtain, store and present mass spectrometry user comments and maintanence records.
